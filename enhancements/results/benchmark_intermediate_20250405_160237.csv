#### 1. **Data Encryption**
NovaTech ensures the confidentiality of data through robust encryption practices:
- **Data at Rest**: All company laptops utilize BitLocker encryption with Trusted Platform Module (TPM) verification and secure boot, safeguarding data stored on devices.
- **Data in Transit**: Remote access to confidential data is secured via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) that requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) through the Okta identity management system. Additionally, access through the company WiFi network mandates 802.1X authentication and an encrypted VPN tunnel using Cisco AnyConnect.

#### 2. **Access Control Measures**
To restrict unauthorized access to confidential data, NovaTech implements several access control strategies:
- **Deny by Default Approach**: Default permissions deny access unless explicitly granted, minimizing exposure.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: New employees are initially granted limited access to essential systems, with any additional access requiring managerial approval via a ServiceNow ticketing system.
- **Privileged Access Control**: Access to sensitive environments necessitates approval from the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and the relevant department head.
- **Temporary Access Expiration**: Any temporary access granted automatically expires after the specified timeframe, reducing the risk of lingering access.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: All access attempts, whether successful or unsuccessful, are logged in the Splunk Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, which generates automated alerts for any suspicious activities.

#### 3. **Security Monitoring and Audits**
NovaTech's Security Operations Center (SOC) conducts regular security audits to monitor and analyze various aspects of the network, including:
- Network traffic
- Endpoint behavior
- Authentication logs
- Data access patterns
- Web filtering logs

These audits ensure compliance with data protection policies and are reviewed annually for legal adherence, contributing to a robust security posture.

#### 4. **Data Classification System**
Confidential data at NovaTech is classified into different sensitivity levels (e.g., Level 1 - Restricted, Level 2 - Confidential). This classification system ensures that data handling procedures are appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.

#### 5. **Employee Training and Responsibility**
Employees are required to sign a Confidentiality Agreement and undergo training on data protection procedures. Violations of these policies are subject to disciplinary action, reinforcing the importance of safeguarding confidential data.

#### 6. **Workstation Security**
To enhance endpoint security, all workstations must have the CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platform and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint installed, providing real-time protection against threats.

When an employee's termination occurs at NovaTech, a structured offboarding procedure is followed to ensure security and compliance. The process is designed to protect sensitive information and maintain the integrity of the organization’s systems. Below are the key steps involved in the employee termination process:

1. **Initiation of Offboarding Workflow**: The Human Resources (HR) department initiates the offboarding workflow through the ServiceNow platform. This step is crucial as it triggers the subsequent actions required for a secure termination.

2. **Access Revocation**: One of the primary security measures taken is the revocation of all access rights. This is executed within four hours of the termination notification. This prompt action helps mitigate any potential risks associated with unauthorized access to company resources.

3. **Deactivation of Digital Access Cards**: Alongside access rights, all digital access cards assigned to the terminated employee are deactivated. This ensures that the individual can no longer enter secure areas or access electronic systems.

4. **Collection and Sanitization of Equipment**: Any company-issued equipment, such as laptops or mobile devices, is collected from the employee. These items are then sanitized in accordance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards to ensure that no sensitive data remains on the devices.

5. **Password Resets on Shared Systems**: To further enhance security, password resets are enforced on shared systems that the terminated employee had access to. This step is vital in preventing any potential misuse of shared credentials.

While the specific documentation required to complete the employee termination process is not detailed in the sources, the outlined procedures reflect a comprehensive approach to managing employee terminations securely at NovaTech.
