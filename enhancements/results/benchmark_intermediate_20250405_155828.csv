- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: New employees are initially granted limited access to essential systems, with any additional access requiring managerial approval via a ServiceNow ticketing system.
- **Privileged Access Control**: Access to sensitive environments necessitates approval from the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and the relevant department head.
- **Temporary Access Expiration**: Any temporary access granted automatically expires after the specified timeframe, reducing the risk of lingering access.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: All access attempts, whether successful or unsuccessful, are logged in the Splunk Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, which generates automated alerts for any suspicious activities.

#### 3. **Security Monitoring and Audits**
NovaTech's Security Operations Center (SOC) conducts regular security audits to monitor and analyze various aspects of the network, including:
- Network traffic
- Endpoint behavior
- Authentication logs
- Data access patterns
- Web filtering logs

These audits ensure compliance with data protection policies and are reviewed annually for legal adherence, contributing to a robust security posture.

#### 4. **Data Classification System**
Confidential data at NovaTech is classified into different sensitivity levels (e.g., Level 1 - Restricted, Level 2 - Confidential). This classification system ensures that data handling procedures are appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.

#### 5. **Employee Training and Responsibility**
Employees are required to sign a Confidentiality Agreement and undergo training on data protection procedures. Violations of these policies are subject to disciplinary action, reinforcing the importance of safeguarding confidential data.
