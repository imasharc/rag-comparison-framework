When an employee is terminated at NovaTech, a structured process is followed to ensure security and compliance with company policies. The termination process encompasses several key steps aimed at revoking access, retrieving company assets, and maintaining the integrity of the organizationâ€™s information systems.

#### Access Revocation Procedures

Upon notification of an employee's termination, the Human Resources (HR) department initiates the offboarding workflow through the ServiceNow platform. This is a critical first step in the process. The following access revocation measures are implemented:

1. **Timely Revocation**: All digital access for the terminated employee is revoked within **4 hours** of the termination notification. This rapid response is crucial to mitigate any potential security risks.
   
2. **Deactivation of Digital Access Cards**: Any digital access cards that the employee possessed are deactivated immediately to prevent unauthorized physical access to company premises.

3. **Password Resets**: For shared systems, password resets are enforced to ensure that the former employee cannot access sensitive information post-termination.

#### Retrieval of Company Assets

In addition to revoking access, NovaTech has established procedures for retrieving company assets from terminated employees:

1. **Equipment Collection**: All company-owned equipment, such as laptops, mobile devices, and other hardware, is collected from the employee. 

2. **Sanitization of Equipment**: The retrieved equipment is sanitized in accordance with **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)** standards to ensure that no sensitive data remains on the devices before they are reassigned or disposed of.

#### Documentation and Compliance

While the specific documentation required to complete the employee termination process is not detailed, it is implied that proper records of the offboarding process, including access revocation and asset retrieval, are maintained to ensure compliance with internal policies and external regulations.

### Conclusion

In summary, NovaTechâ€™s employee termination process is designed to protect the organization by ensuring swift revocation of access and retrieval of company assets. By following these structured procedures, NovaTech aims to maintain a secure environment and safeguard its information systems against potential threats posed by former employees.",10.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,9.166666666666666
What happens during employee termination at NovaTech?,Chain-of-Thought RAG,"During employee termination at NovaTech, a structured offboarding process is implemented to ensure security and compliance. HR initiates an offboarding workflow in ServiceNow, which triggers several critical actions: all access to company systems and resources is revoked within 4 hours of the termination notification, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Company equipment is collected and sanitized according to NIST standards to protect sensitive information. Additionally, digital access cards are deactivated, and password resets are enforced on shared systems to further safeguard against potential security breaches. This comprehensive approach ensures that NovaTech maintains a secure environment even after an employee's departure. For specific policy references, please consult the sections on ""Employee Offboarding"" and ""Access Control"" in the NovaTech security policy documentation.",10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0
What happens during employee termination at NovaTech?,Few-Shot RAG,"According to NovaTech's Security Policy (Section: Employee Termination Process), the following security procedures are implemented during the employee termination process:

1. **Offboarding Workflow Initiation**: HR initiates an offboarding workflow in ServiceNow to ensure a structured and documented termination process.
   
2. **Access Revocation**: All access to company systems and data is revoked within 4 hours of receiving the termination notification to prevent unauthorized access.

3. **Equipment Collection and Sanitization**: All company-issued equipment is collected from the terminated employee. This equipment is then sanitized according to NIST standards to ensure that no sensitive data remains accessible.

4. **Digital Access Card Deactivation**: Any digital access cards issued to the employee are deactivated immediately to restrict physical access to company facilities.

5. **Password Resets**: Passwords for shared systems are reset to prevent any potential misuse of accounts after the employee's departure.

These procedures are crucial for maintaining the security of company data and systems by ensuring that access privileges are promptly removed and that sensitive information is adequately protected. The policy is documented in the Security Policy document NTD-SEC-001-2025 (version 3.2), approved by CEO Michael Rodriguez and effective as of February 1, 2025.",10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0

Final Response:
Thank you for your question regarding the employee termination process at NovaTech Dynamics. As outlined in our security policy (Document ID: NTD-SEC-001-2025), we have implemented a comprehensive offboarding workflow to ensure the security of our systems and data during employee terminations. 

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the process:

1. **Initiation by HR**: The offboarding workflow is initiated by our Human Resources department in ServiceNow. This step is crucial as it formally triggers the entire termination process and ensures that all necessary actions are tracked and documented.

2. **Access Revocation**: All access rights are revoked within 4 hours of the termination notification. This rapid response is vital to mitigate any risk of unauthorized access to our systems or sensitive information. It aligns with our commitment to maintaining strict access controls as per Section 4.2 of our security policy.

3. **Equipment Collection and Sanitization**: All company equipment issued to the employee is collected and sanitized according to NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) standards. This ensures that no residual data remains on devices, protecting our intellectual property and sensitive information from potential breaches.

4. **Deactivation of Digital Access Cards**: Digital access cards are deactivated promptly to prevent physical access to our facilities. This step is essential for maintaining the integrity of our physical security measures.

5. **Password Resets on Shared Systems**: We enforce password resets on shared systems to ensure that any credentials associated with the terminated employee are rendered invalid. This is a critical measure to prevent any potential misuse of accounts.

The rationale behind these procedures is to ensure that we maintain a secure environment and protect our assets, which is especially important in light of compliance requirements such as ISO 27001 and SOC 2. These standards emphasize the importance of access control and data protection, which are integral to our security posture.
